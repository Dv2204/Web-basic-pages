    <h1>About Hacktoberfest</h1>
    <p>Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software sponsored by Digital Ocean, Intel, and DEV. The
        goal of the event is to encourage participation in the open-source community all across the globe. ... Open four
        high-quality pull requests in October on any open source project to get some swags</p>

    <h1>why contribute in hacktoberfest</h1>
    <p>By participating in Hacktoberfest, your repository will receive more traffic from developers who are looking to
        participate. So, even when Hacktoberfest ends, if these developers liked the experience of contributing to your
        repository, they will come back to help with more issues.</p>

    <h1>Who is Hacktoberfest for?</h1>
    <p>Short answer â€” everyone. That is of course a stretch as a cleaning lady will probably not code a new feature for
        her favorite repository (doesn't mean she can't! ðŸ¤“). Hacktoberfest is all about community, working as a team,
        and most importantly â€” having fun!</p>
